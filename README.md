## How to use

Open `index.html` in a browser. Click the hamburger menu (top right) to set the duration and enter fullscreen. Hover over the side rail to use Start/Pause and Reset. On a touchscreen, tap the translucent buttons.

Keyboard shortcuts: **Space** starts/pauses; **R** resets; **F** toggles fullscreen; **M** opens/closes settings.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

## Browser limitations

Fullscreen requires a user gesture and is not supported by every mobile browser. Audio may require prior interaction. When the device sleeps, a tab is suspended, or the browser is closed, an on-time alarm cannot be guaranteed. The displayed remaining time corrects itself when the page resumes.
